        <h2>Cooking Stuff</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I began cooking at age 12.</li>
          <li>I started learning in a cooking class at my middle school.</li>
          <li>After the class, I continued cooking on my own.</li>
          <li>The first foreign foods I learned to cook were Chinese and Japanese.</li>
          <li>My growing interest in Asian cuisine led me to try local Indian restaurants.</li>
          <li>I became a regular at a restaurant called Ruchi.</li>
          <li>After trying much of their menu, I decided to start cooking my own Indian food.</li>
          <li>PS: Ruchi's quality has significantly declined since I began going there :(</li>
