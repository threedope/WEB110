        <p>
          A variant of the well-known spiced rice dish, biryani, made in the style common to the Chettinad locality of southern India.
          <br><br>
          The Chettinad biryani recipe I follow includes mushrooms marinaded in a mixture of a green masala, spices, and Greek yogurt. The green masala consists of blended mint, coriander, chilies, garlic, ginger, and a little water.
          <br><br>
          Now prepare an aromatic mix of turmeric, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, peppercorn, and fennel seeds to add into the rice while it cooks. Dice a large onion and 2 large tomatoes.
          <br><br>
          Once everything is ready, saute your aromatics with onions, tomato, and marinaded mushrooms in ghee for about 7 minutes. Now add 1 cup of cream and some salt. Finally, add uncooked rice, mix well, and cook until the rice has a pleasant texture - usually about 30 to 40 minutes depending on portion size.
          <br><br>
          This biryani is creamy, spicy, and tangy. Top with hardboiled eggs for some protein and fresh coriander for extra flavor.

        <h2>Tofu Palak Paneer</h2>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          Keeping paneer in the name of this dish is a misnomer, as the titular cheese cubes are substituted with tofu for a more balanced nutritional profile.
          <br><br>
          The curry base is palak - a blend of spinach, tomato, onion, dairy or coconut cream, and a masala spice mixture. Most Indian curries contain tomato and onion.
          <br><br>
          I suggest using extra firm tofu that's stored frozen then thawed before being pressed of its water. 
          <br><br>
          Pressing is the process of removing water from tofu by wrapping it in a towel then placing a weight on top, like a heavy cast iron skillet, for around 30 minutes.
          <br><br>
          FYI: Freezing tofu makes it more porous because water expands as it freezes. Since pressing tofu expels water absorbed during its production, tofu becomes like a sponge for marinades and sauces as a result. Using frozen tofu for every recipe is <b>not</b> recommended, as freezing also changes the texture of tofu.

        <h2>Dal</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
          Dal is a favorite amongst vegetarians for being quick, easy, and delicious.
          <br><br>
          The word dal in Hindi actually refers to a variety of legumes. In the context of a dish you might order at a restaurant, dal refers to a lentil or chickpea based curry.
          <br><br>
          Dal is a great meal for beginners of Indian cooking to experiment with. One of the most basic ways to make dal is by heating a rough puree of lentils and water then adding salt, cumin, and turmeric for seasoning. Dal is typically eaten with naan or rice.
          <br><br>
          Although dal can be very simple, recipes frequently incorporate tomatoes, onions, garlic, mango, plus other ingredients and spices to sweeten the dish or enhance its savory qualities.

        <h2>Rasam</h2>
        <div class="picture-right">

        </div>
        <p>
          Rasam is an Indian spiced tomato soup-like dish with a thinner consistency. Rasam is sometimes served over rice instead of being eaten as a soup. Rasam's flavor is usually a mixture of spicy, sour, and sweet.
          <br><br>
          Individual recipes emphasize different flavors and thus are highly varied. I prefer a rather spicy, moderately sour, and slightly sweet rasam served alongside naan.
          <br><br>
          I begin my rasam by cooking diced tomatoes in ghee on medium-high heat in a large pot until the tomatoes begin to break down and a reduction forms. Next, any seasonings are added and simmered in the reduction until strongly fragrant. Broth is then mixed in, brought to a boil, and allowed to cook for at least 15 minutes on medium-low heat. Voila.
